# Kaggle Projects
This repository contains my personal projects on Kaggle. 
Each project is represented in the Jupyter notebook.

## List of Projects:
1. Spaceship Titanic:
A modification of the famous Titanic dataset problem. The goal is 
to predict who survives or not given a set of feature variables

2. Kaggle 2022 Data Science and Machine Learning Survey:
A dashboard for the Kaggle 2022 survey. I use visualization libraries
to understand the trends, challenges and tools used by data scientists
and machine learning practitioners.
