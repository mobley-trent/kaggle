# Kaggle Projects
This repository contains my personal projects on Kaggle. 
Each project is represented in the Jupyter notebook.

## List of Projects:
1. Spaceship Titanic:
A modification of the famous Titanic dataset problem. The goal is 
to predict who survives or not given a set of feature variables

2. Kaggle 2022 Data Science and Machine Learning Survey:
A dashboard for the Kaggle 2022 survey. I use visualization libraries
to understand the trends, challenges and tools used by data scientists
and machine learning practitioners.

3. Tesla Stock Price Analysis and Prediction with Deep Learning:
In this notebook, we will first perform EDA on the Tesla stock prices dataset to understand the trends and patterns in the data. Next, we will use a LSTM deep learning model to predict future stock prices.

4. Customer Segmentation:
A comprehensive analysis of customer data in a mall with K-means clustering.

5. IMDB Sentiment Analysis:
Contextual Mining on text from IMDB movie reviews.
